# BellyButtonDemographics

## Purpose of the dashboard
to hel Roza's test volunteers visualize the bacterial data for each test. 
Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, 
Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
